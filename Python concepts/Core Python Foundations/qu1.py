## Write a Python program that:

# Takes two numbers from the user.

# Prints the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.

# Checks if the first number is greater than the second and prints the result.

# Checks if the first number is divisible by the second and prints True or False.


a = float(input("Enter your 1st number : "))
b = float(input("Enter your 2nd number : "))


print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print( a > b )
print( a % b == 0)
