#I understand about random module in it. 
# random => helps to choose characters randomly. 
# basically uses some kind of seed in order to create random random.

# random() -> returns a float between 0 and 1. 
# randinit(a,b) -> returns a int between a,b 
# choice(sequnce) -> returns one random element. 

import random # to impornt any module. 
#module is a just a file that comtains python code functions classses variables. 
# like a tool box

#* 
a = random.random() # returns a random float b/w integer. 

print(a)

b = random.randint(2,5) #returns an integer. 
# so there are things like such.
